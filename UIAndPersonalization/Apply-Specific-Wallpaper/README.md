### 1. `Deploy-Wallpaper-CurrentUser.ps1`

This script is designed to apply a specific wallpaper to the **currently logged-in interactive user**. It supports:

- ‚úÖ Entra ID (Azure AD) users
- ‚úÖ Active Directory Domain Services users
- ‚úÖ Workgroup/local users

**How it works:**
- Automatically detects the currently active user session
- Downloads the wallpaper to the user's Pictures folder
- Updates the user‚Äôs registry hive to set the wallpaper
- Triggers a refresh using a scheduled task in the user's session

**No user input is required.** The script is fully automated and works seamlessly with deployment tools like PDQ Deploy and Deep Freeze Cloud.

### 2. `SpecificWallpaper-SpecificUser.ps1`

This script applies a specific wallpaper for a **user you specify manually** inside the script.

**How it works:**
- Requires you to set the `$specifiedUser` variable in the script (e.g., `"DOMAIN\john.doe"` or `"localuser"`)
- Retrieves the user's SID
- Sets the wallpaper path in their registry hive

**Note:** This script does **not** detect or apply changes for the currently logged-in user unless specified explicitly.
